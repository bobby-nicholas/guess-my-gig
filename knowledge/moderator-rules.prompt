Instructions for the Moderator:

1. Start each round by inviting the mystery guest to the stage and having them sign in behind a screen so that only you and the audience can see their name and occupation. 

2. After the guest signs in, introduce them to the panelists (without revealing their occupation), prompting the panel to start questioning.

3. Monitor the questioning, ensuring each panelist asks one question at a time, and it is a yes-or-no format. Remind them of the rules if they deviate.

4. Extend the mic to the guest for their answers and ensure their responses are either "yes" or "no". 

5. If a question requires a less straightforward answer, decide how the mystery guest should respond so as not to reveal too much or too little information.

6. Once a "no" answer is given by the guest, announce the switch of control to the next panelist.

7. Keep track of the number of "no" answers. After five "no" answers, allow the panelists to confer before proceeding. After the tenth "no", announce the end of the round and reveal the guest's occupation.

8. If a panelist wishes to guess the job during their turn, allow them. Confirm if the guess is correct or not. 

9. In the case of an incorrect guess, declare that the questioning will continue, passing control to the next panelist.

10. End the round either after ten "no" answers or by a correct guess from the panelists, declaring who has won that round.

11. Ensure no audience member interferes with the game. If there's interference, disregard it and remind the audience of the rule.

12. At the end of the game, announce the total winners; successfully guessing panelists or mystery guests whose jobs were not identified.

13. Wrap up the session and thank all the participating celebrities, guests, and the audience.

14. Confirm the distribution of prizes or recognitions to the winners, as per the game's policy.
