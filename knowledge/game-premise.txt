Guess My Gig!

Synopsis:
"Guess My Gig!" is a nostalgic, thrilling throwback to the classic 1950's game show "What's My Line?", but updated for the modern era, with all the crazy side-hustles, gigs, and careers that make the modern world possible. In this reboot, a panel of celebrity sleuths must work together to decipher the secret occupations of mystery guests. The show combines humor, curiosity, and a touch of nostalgia, as the panel asks yes-or-no questions to reveal the guest's profession, job, or vocation. It's a guessing game that keeps everyone, from the studio audience to the viewers at home, eagerly on the edge of their seats!

Rules:

Game Structure:
- The game comprises several rounds, each featuring a new mystery guest with an occupation for the panel to guess.
- The show is comprised of a moderator who directs the game, a panel of four celebrity sleuths, and multiple mystery guests.
- The rounds continue until the panel correctly guesses the guest's occupation or runs out of questions.

Roles & Player Types:
- Moderator: Guides the game, keeps track of the questions and answers, and has the final say in any disputes.
- Celebrity Panelists: Four celebrities who ask yes-or-no questions to determine the guest's occupation. They take turns questioning and can confer before guessing.
- Mystery Guest: An individual with a unique or interesting occupation. The guest can answer only "yes" or "no" to the panel's questions.

Rules of Play:
- Each guest is introduced and signs in so that only the audience and moderator know their name and occupation.
- Panel members take turns asking yes-or-no questions to the mystery guest.
- The guest can answer only with "yes" or "no." If the guest must clarify or provide a less straightforward answer, the moderator will decide how to proceed.
- If a panelist's question is met with a "no" answer, control passes to the next panelist. Ten "no" answers, and the round ends with the guest winning that round.
- The panelists are allowed to confer with one another after every fifth "no."
- The panel can make a guess at the occupation at any time during their turn. If a panelist guesses correctly, the round ends with the panel winning. Otherwise, questioning continues.
- The questioning goes on until the panel guesses the job or fails after ten "no" answers.
- The mystery guest wins a prize if their job is not guessed correctly after ten "no" responses.

Allowed & Forbidden Actions:
- Panelists must frame all questions in a yes-or-no format.
- Mystery guests cannot lie in response to questions. If a mystery job requires certain confidentiality, the moderator can allow vague answers.
- Panelists are forbidden from asking about the guest's specific place of work or their name.
- Audience members, including the studio audience and those at home, are not allowed to aid the panel in any way.

Winning the Game:
- For the panelists, the game is won by successfully identifying the occupation of all mystery guests during the show.
- For the mystery guests, they win by stumping the panel with ten "no" answers.
- If a round ends with the panel's incorrect guess, the mystery guest still wins that round.
- Prizes or recognitions can be awarded to both the successful panelists and mystery guests who stump the panel.
